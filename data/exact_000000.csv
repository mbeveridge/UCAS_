"Disclosure controls have been applied to the data to reduce the risk of disclosing personal data about identifiable individuals."
"For counts, the controls include reporting each cell count to the nearest five. In particular cell counts of 1 and 2 are reported as 0. Rows that only report 0 are omitted from the output. These controls are applied to each cell independently so this may result in instances where totals do not equal the sum of the components."
"For derived statistics (e.g. means), to ensure these disclosure controls are not undone, a minor adjustment is applied, if necessary, such that the set of records contributing to each cell matches the reported cell count (to the nearest five). This involves either removing 1 or 2 records at random, or adding in 1 or 2 duplicates at random. If the number of values contributing to a cell is 1, 2 or 0 then it is displayed as ‘N’. Rows that only report ‘N’ are omitted from the output."
